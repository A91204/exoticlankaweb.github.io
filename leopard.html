            <h3>Poaching</h3>
            <p>Poaching poses a severe threat to Sri Lankan leopards, leading to a decline in their population. Consequences include disruption of the ecosystem balance.</p>
            <p>Therefore, measures have been implemented to mitigate the impact. Stricter law enforcement, including penalties for poaching, serves as a deterrent. Increased patrols in leopard habitats act as a protective measure, monitoring and preventing illegal activities. Community awareness programs aim to educate and involve local communities in the conservation effort, fostering a sense of responsibility for the well-being of the leopards and their habitat.</p>

            <img src="habitat loss.jpeg" alt="Habitat Loss Threat">
            <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>
            <p>Urbanization and deforestation are threatening the habitats of Sri Lankan leopards, making it challenging for them to survive. This not only affects the leopards but also leads to conflicts between them and nearby communities.</p>
            <p>In response to habitat loss, conservation efforts have been initiated to address the consequences. Reforestation projects aim to restore the green spaces crucial for leopards, providing them with suitable habitats. Habitat restoration initiatives focus on creating corridors and protected areas to facilitate the movement of leopards and reduce conflicts with human populations. Community-based conservation programs engage local communities in sustainable practices and encourage coexistence, minimizing the negative consequences of habitat loss.</a>
